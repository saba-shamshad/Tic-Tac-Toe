🎮 **Tic Tac Toe - Java Desktop Game**

Hello there! 👋
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe Game built using Java Swing for GUI. It's a classic 2-player game (Player X and Player O) where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. First to line up three marks — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally — wins the game!

If you enjoy simple logic games or you're exploring GUI development in Java, feel free to try this one.



📦 **Features**

✅ 2-player local gameplay

✅ Win counter for both players (counts wins across multiple rounds)

✅ "Play Again" option without losing win count

✅ Simple, colorful GUI layout

✅ Winning area highlighted

✅ Draw detection with option to restart

✅ Images/icons for better look



🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- Java

- Swing (for GUI components)

- AWT (for layout management)

- Basic ImageIcons for logo/icons



🎮 **How to Play**

1. Run the project (using .jar or through IDE like NetBeans/VS Code).


2. Two players take turns clicking on the grid.


3. First player to align 3 of their symbols (X or O) wins.


4. Win counts are displayed below the game title.


5. Click "Play Again" to start a new round — win counts remain.


6. In case of a draw, win counts reset to 0 for both players.
